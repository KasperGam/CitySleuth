I know he was rough around the edges, but he was always a pretty good guy, at least he was here.  Definitely a drinker, but never gave me too much trouble.\n\nIt’s a shame about his girl, but I can’t imagine Mark could’ve done it.  When I say he was only gone for ten minutes that night, I mean he was only gone for ten minutes.  He left at 11.30.  I have to take heart medication, and have an alarm set on my phone for then.  When I stepped out back on a break to take it, I saw Mark leaving the bar.  My break only lasts 10 minutes, and he was back around the time I went back inside.  He’d mentioned earlier he’d forgotten his wallet, and since Line lived close by, I assumed that’s where he’d left it. He definitely had it when he got back; I can show you the receipts for his credit card. His mood didn’t seem any different when he came back.  He left at closing, which is around 2, with a few of his buddies.  He was pretty sloshed.  I know he got into some trouble in the past, but he loved Line.\n\nShe was a sweetie, I don’t know who’d want to hurt her.  She’d come in here with Mark occasionally. Always had a smile on. She hung out with that bitch Kristine, but that was only thing I could say was a “fault.”  (chuckles) The only time I ever had trouble with Mark, here, would be when Kristine or that weird neighbor, Carle, showed up. She’d come in, never when Line was here I don’t think, and just start yelling at Mark, who would always yell back. I unofficially banned her from coming in here, but I’d occasionally catch her smoking outside, probably waiting for Mark to leave. She always used the excuse that she was just out buying cigarettes from the 7/11 near here.  I mean, I do see her at the 7/11 a lot, but I think she had it in for Mark.\n\nCarle was more annoying than anything else.  He’d try to casually sneak into the bar and Mark would always tell him off. I never really asked about it. I didn’t want to get more involved.\n\nI really hope you catch who did this.  And I really hope it wasn’t Mark.",

The bartender and I are pretty friendly, so he knew I was good for it.  I remembered having it at Line’s earlier in the day, so I walked there from the bar.\n\nI let myself into the apartment with my key, and noticed the lights were out.  My wallet was on the kitchen counter, and when I picked it up I could see through the bedroom door.  I thought she -- Line -- was sleeping, so I quietly grabbed my wallet and left. I’m pretty sure I locked the door when I left. Besides me and Line, Kristine had the only other key to the apartment, in case one of us got locked out. Line sometimes goes to sleep early, and I had already had a few drinks, I guess I didn’t think anything of it.\n\nI got back to the bar, it couldn’t have taken more than 15 minutes.  Afterwards, I had one too many drinks and my friends helped me back to one of their apartments.  I crashed on the couch. The next morning, I returned to Line’s apartment… I was worried she’d overslept her alarm, so I tried to wake her up… and… she was just like lying there. I called the police immediately and they arrived twenty minutes later.\n\nLine and I had been dating on and off for several years. We argued sometimes, pretty intensely.  But I would never kill her!  I was just worried about her.  She was really independent, and I was always worried something would happen to her.  The city’s pretty peaceful, but there are always bad guys looking for vulnerable people.  Line would stay late at that coffee place she worked at… you know, the one on Kompagnistraede... with the bread in the window?  She insisted on walking home alone and I was worried she would get attacked.  People noticed her.  People like that weird neighbor of hers.  Have you talked to him yet?  I’m pretty sure he was stalking her.    I could see him looking over at her windows from his apartment.  She tried to get a restraining order and everything.  You should be talking to him… not me.\n\nI would never hurt Line."

Mark was just more long-term than the previous ones.  And I mean, she had choices.  It wasn’t just petty criminals or creepers like Carle, you know, her neighbor?  Everyone liked Line.\n\nI can’t believe there’s even a doubt that Mark did it. I mean, he was in her apartment on the night of the murder around the time she (stops, she’s a little choked up) died!\n\nGod, I knew something was going to happen.  I mean, Mark had gotten so overprotective as of late, making her check in with him when she went places alone.  Not that I blame him completely, with the messages Line had started getting.  The police didn’t seem that concerned with them, but they freaked me the hell out.  I can send you the screenshots I took if you want.I think it was probably Carle. I would’ve already confronted him about it, but with everything that’s been going on I just haven’t had the energy.  You’re welcome to talk to him about it.  He lives in the brick building across from Line’s apartment. Above some wine shop.\n\nMy key to Line’s apartment went missing around the same time of the messages as well.  I looked everywhere for it. Line had scheduled an appointment to get the locks changed… it was, um, supposed to be next week.  I actually found the key this morning, outside the cafe. I could’ve sworn I looked there when I’d initially lost it."

               "testimony": "Mark’s been talking about me? Of course he is, he thinks by yelling about everyone else the police will forget that he’s guilty.  It’s just sad.\n\nI’ll tell you what I told the police. I liked Line. She was a beautiful, interesting woman.  Maybe I was a little jealous of Mark, but I would never hurt Line because of that.  I know about the restraining order she tried to file.  I guess I crossed some lines, I don’t know, I just wanted to be around her. I never threatened her or anything. I can’t believe anyone, the police or Mark or whoever, would even suggest that.  They might as well be questioning Kristine, you know, she doesn’t have an alibi at all for the night of the murder.\n\nThe night of Line’s murder, I was here at home alone for most of the night. Line’s lights were on around 10.30.  I took a shower a little after that and when I got out, around 11 ish, the lights were out.  I saw a man leaving the building, but it was too dark to really make out many details.  I think it was probably Mark, but I guess it might’ve been someone else.\n\nI miss Line.  She was always so friendly.  I’m looking after her cat, Sprinkles, now.  I guess Kristine is allergic.  She’s a sweet cat, but I can’t look at her without reminding myself of Line."
