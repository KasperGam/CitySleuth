I left around 8:00 pm, and did not see the victim arrive back. I spent several hours there, but when the time came to pay my tab, I realized I did not have my wallet with me and must have left it at the apartment. I went back to get it, noticing the victim was asleep (so I presumed) and quietly retrieved it and returned to the bar. Afterwards, I had one too many drinks and was helped by a friend back to his place where I crashed on the couch. The next day, I returned to the apartment to find the horrific scene. I pulled back the pillow and comforter to find her dead. I called the police immediately and they arrived around 10:45 am. Lina and I have been dating on and off for several years. We often get into heated arguments that end pretty badly. But I would never hurt her or do anything like this. In fact, I know the guy across the street is always looking over her into this apartment, with a weird face that is hard to read."

Mark was just more long-term than the previous ones.  And I mean, she had choices.  It wasn’t just petty criminals or creepers like that neighbor.  Everyone liked Line. \nI can’t believe there’s even a doubt that Mark did it. I mean, he was in her apartment on the night of the murder around the time of death!\nGod, I knew something was going to happen.  I mean, Mark had gotten so overprotective as of late, making her check in with him when she went places alone.  Not that I blame him completely.

On the night in question (Friday, April 14, 2017), we were the last two finishing up for the night and getting ready for the weekend. I was going to a concert later that night, but told her to go ahead as she had put in a good day’s work and the concert was close to the shop. She left around 8:45 pm and I closed up and left shortly after, around 9:00 pm. I then attended the concert, and took pictures that I uploaded to my tumblr page when there. After the concert ended, around 2:00 am, I headed home, arriving there around 2:30 am. I did not hear what happened until I opened the shop at our saturday opening of 12:00 pm and the victim and her best friend did not come in for their shifts. I called, and upon hearing what happened, was appalled and understood Kristine’s grief. It is a tragedy. She had heard from Mark, who I have never liked. If he ended up doing this I will never forgive him. He didn’t deserve her."
